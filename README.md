# Calculator - By Nika Ribnitski

A calculator I made for my software engineering class. 
It is capable of doing operations with mulitple values and operators, follows BEDMAS, and limits the use of the decimal to once per number.


To run this program, download the files and use the Android Studio emulator.

If you just want to see my code (for style/alorithm analysis) see:
